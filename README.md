# Web Development Project 4 - The Dog API

Submitted by: Dianna

This web app: 
We will be able to generate a random photo of a dog by making API calls. By doing this we can see the photo of the dog, and a brief description of their characteristics. 

If there is a attribute that we do not want to see (such as breed name) We will be able to filter it the next time we make a API call

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x ] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [ x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x ] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x ] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x ] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x ] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x ] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:
